## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to determine if a combination ice cream and surf shop would succeed in Oahu, Hawaii. The weather would have a large impact on the number of customers the shop gets, so the investors wanted an analysis of the Oahu weather data. Therefore, I extracted the weather from all the June and December months in the dataset to compare the summer and winter weather.


## Results
Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
There is a bulleted list that addresses the three key differences in weather between June and December.
