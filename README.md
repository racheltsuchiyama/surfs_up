## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to determine if a combination ice cream and surf shop would succeed in Oahu, Hawaii. The weather would have a large impact on the number of customers the shop gets, so the investors wanted an analysis of the Oahu weather data. Therefore, I extracted the weather from all the June and December months in the dataset to compare the summer and winter weather.


## Results

### June

* The average temperature in June was only about 5 degrees (F) warmer than the average temperature in December.
* The maximum temperature in June was only 2 degrees (F) warmer than the maximum temperature in December.
* The minimum temperature in December was 8 degrees (F)  colder than the minimum temperature in June.


## Summary

The June months had warmer temperatures than the December months. The average temperature and quartiles were all higher in June than December. However, the difference between the two was not very significant. Therefore, the temperatures throughout the year in Oahu would not drive customers away. However, one investor was particularly concerned about the precipitation having a negative impact on the store's success. I would write additional queries measuring the precipitation levels in the June and December months.

Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
